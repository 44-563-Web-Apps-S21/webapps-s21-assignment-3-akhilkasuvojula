              <h3>Hang out with family</h3>
              <p>
                  My favorite thing to do is to spend time with my family. I know, the most cliché answer possible, 
                  but seriously. I also have a sibling much younger than me.<b>The time I spend with him takes me back 
                  to being a kid again.</b>So,my favorite thing to do would probably be playing video games with him, 
                  or eating dinner with my family.<b>Cherish the time that you have with those around you that love 
                  you.</b> Time is truly the most valuable thing that you possess.
