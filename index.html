        <h6>Hang out with family</h6>
        <p>My favorite thing to do is to spend time with my family. I know, the most clich√© answer possible, but seriously. Having grown up and moved away, it is so easy to see what I did not just a few years ago- the time you will spend with your family is the best time you will ever have. I also have a sibling much younger than me. The time I spend with him takes me back to being a kid again. It is truly amazing to witness the purity of a child. To be a role model of his is one of the most humbling things that I have ever experienced. So, my favorite thing to do would probably be playing video games with him, or eating dinner with my family. Cherish the time that you have with those around you that love you. Time is truly the most valuable thing that you possess</p>
